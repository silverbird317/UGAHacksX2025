Shadow Game

# Blurb
Explore new perspectives in this spatial reasoning puzzle game. Run through the debris of forgotten mysteries and piece together the life of those who left it behind. Proof-of-concept.

## Inspiration
We saw a cool shadow on the ground. Waow. Why does it not look anything like the object that cast the shadow? And so we thought it would be a fun concept to work with.

## What it does
It's a cool puzzle game; both in mechanical puzzles and narrative. 

## How we built it
Unity3D for main game; 2D for platforming; the one free OpenCV integration to use some image processing functionalities from the wonderful world of python libraries.

## Challenges we ran into
OpenCV functions that worked better were all locked behind a $399 paywall. What was supported was also rather old.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting it to work, the image processing integration.

## What we learned
People really like putting a big price tag on code integrations.

## What's next for Image Processing OpenCV Computer Vision Unity3D Amazing Game
Coming up with a good title.
